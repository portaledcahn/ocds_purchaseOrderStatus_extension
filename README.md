# Purchase Order Status

In Honduras, the purchase orders made in a Framework Agreement setting go through different states in an approval process. 

This extension adds the field "contracts/purchaseOrderStatus" to indicate the current status of a purchase order, represented as a contract in a OCDS release. Read the [codelist file](codelists/purchaseOrderStatus.csv) for a list of the status values available.
